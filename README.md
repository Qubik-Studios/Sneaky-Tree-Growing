## Features

This mod allows you to sneak within a 6x6 area to apply the Bone-meal effect to saplings/seeds/other blocks.
You have the flexibility to adjust the radius and probability of this effect through the Config. Additionally, you can
activate specific features, such as a mode that extends the Bone-meal effect to seeds and crops.
Using this mod will gradually deplete your food level, which can be customized in the Config.
Furthermore, you have the option to remove Bone-meal from your inventory with ease.

## Custom Tags and Blocks

In the newest version you can now add tags from mods that are not supported. As example, you can add manually support
for
Dynamic tree's.
Just go for that in the config and add your favorite mod tag in the section: "Custom-Tags = []"
An example how you use the custom tag system is in the Config.

Version 1.10 and up:<br>
There is a new Config for Normal Blocks. You can add every Single block you like to get the Effect applied.

## Config

Starting with Version 1.10 of SneakyTreeGrowing the config is split into 2 parts making it incompatible for older
Versions.
We want to reduce the complicated overview of the file and with the Block-Tags.
